Obsverable Trends
------------------------------------------------------

1. Mouse ID g989 had duplicate varying tumor sizes at the same timepoints and had to therefor be excluded in the analysis

2. Capomulin and Ramicane had the lowest tumor volum of 40.68 mm and 40.22 mm respectively. 
They both were also the only drug regimens that had a standard error below 5, implying the more reliable choice. 
Furthermore, they were the most popular drug regimen with at 230 and 228 mices respectively.

3. There is a potential outlier in the Infubinol regimen as a mouse had a tumour volume (36.32 mm) below the lower bound (36.83 mm). 
However, it is by a relatively small amount.

4. There is a strong positive correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume at 0.83. 
This indicates that as mouse weight rises, the potential tumor size follows.
